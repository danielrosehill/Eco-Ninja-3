# Calculated Values

Here is the data converted into a table format, including the calculations for emissions and their monetized values:

## Exxon (XOM), 2023 GHG Emissions Data

| **Scope**                            | **Emissions (million metric tons of CO2e)** | **Monetized Emissions (in million USD)** |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Scope 1 Emissions, Operated Basis    | 92                                         | 21,712                                   |
| Scope 2 Emissions, Operated Basis (Location Based) | 7                                          | 1,652                                    |
| Scope 2 Emissions, Operated Basis (Market Based)   | 6                                          | 1,416                                    |
| Scope 3 Emissions                    | 540                                        | 127,440                                  |
| **All Scope Emissions**              | **639**                                    | **152,220**                              |

## Monetised Emissions All Scopes

$152,220M = $152.22BN (billion, USD)

### Notes:
- The **All Scope Emissions** is the sum of Scope 1, Scope 2 (Location Based), and Scope 3 emissions: $$92 + 7 + 540 = 639$$ million metric tons of CO2e.
- The **monetized emissions** are calculated by multiplying each scope's emissions by a factor of $236 million.
- The **All Emissions Monetized** value is the total of all monetized emissions: $$21,712 + 1,652 + 1,416 + 127,440 = 152,220$$ million USD.
